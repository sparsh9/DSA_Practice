// Approach:
    // Basically starting from vertex 0 color one by one the different vertices. 

// Base condition:
    // If I have colored all the N nodes return true.

// Recursion:
    // Trying every color from 1 to m with the help of a for a loop.
    // Is safe function returns true if it is possible to color it with that color i.e none of the adjacent nodes have the same color.
    // In case this is an algorithm and follows a certain intuition, please mention it. 
    // Color it with color i then call the recursive function for the next node if it returns true we will return true.
    // And If it is false then take off the color.
    // Now if we have tried out every color from 1 to m and it was not possible to color it with any of the m colors then return false.
